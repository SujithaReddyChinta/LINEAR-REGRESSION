Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, represented by a straight line in a scatter plot. The goal is to find the line that best fits the data by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values (least squares method). Linear regression provides insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between variables and can be extended to multiple dimensions (multiple linear regression). It's widely used in economics, social sciences, engineering, and machine learning for prediction and inference.
